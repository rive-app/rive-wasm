A JavaScript/TypeScript and Web Assembly ([WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)) runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app).

This library allows full control over Rive files with a high-level API for hooking up many simple interactions and animations, as well as a low-level API that allows you to drive your own render loop to create multiple artboards, animations, and state machines all in one canvas.

## Rive Overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.

## Getting Started

Follow along with the link below for a quick start in getting Rive JS integrated into your web applications.

[Getting Started with Rive in Web](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/overview/web-js)

[API documentation](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/overview/web-js/rive-parameters)

## Supported Browsers

Rive can be used in all major browsers. We're constantly working to improve performance with our renderer so that animations playback smoothly for all.

## Examples

Check out our Storybook instance that shows how to use the library in small examples, along with code snippets! This includes examples using the basic component, as well as the convenient hooks exported to take advantage of state machines.
